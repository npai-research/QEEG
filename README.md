# QEEG
Processed EEG data

Each file corresponds to the processed data from the written tasks within EEGLAB, prepared for quantitative EEG, and is organized as follows:
Participant Number_Task_Group. Example: 65_WW_01
65 to 73: Participant
WW: Waking Writing 
T2: Second written task (Creative Writing (CW), which was restricted to the control group, and Psychography (PSYC), which was restricted to the medium group)
01: control group
02: medium group

QEEG 80 epochs delta_theta_alpha_beta 1_beta 2 Ind_Reg_Elet 

Quantitative EEG using the first 80 epochs of each file from the written tasks per frequency band, separated by: global data (Ind), hemisphere-specific data (Reg), and electrode-specific data (Elet).
